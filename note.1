Issue:
	if piped still generating color

The options are as follows:

*    -b      Number the non-blank output lines, starting at 1.

     -e      Display non-printing characters (see the -v option), and display a dollar sign (`$') at the end of each line.

*    -n      Number the output lines, starting at 1.

*    -s      Squeeze multiple adjacent empty lines, causing the output to be single spaced.

     -t      Display non-printing characters (see the -v option), and display tab characters as `^I'.

+    -u      Disable output buffering.
				PJS: -u do a flush after every line

     -v      Display non-printing characters so they are visible.  Control characters print as `^X' for control-X; the delete
             character (octal 0177) prints as `^?'.  Non-ASCII characters (with the high bit set) are printed as `M-' (for meta)
             followed by the character for the low 7 bits.

Color Options
	-C color-speck				set the color to use
	-color color-speck

	-r "re"						Only color stuff that matches with the regular expression
	--regexp "re"

*	-F 							Force output to have color, normally piped to file is w/o color.
	--forcedcolor		
								1. change to MiscLib for this
								2. Check on stdout to file - check -

Plan:
	Need a color-cat.config.json with
